# MaizePredictionModeling-ArcGISPro

This repository contains an ArcGIS Pro-based project for maize yield prediction modeling. It uses geospatial data to analyze factors such as soil properties, rainfall, temperature, and elevation to model maize suitability and predict potential yields.

## Features
- Spatial analysis of maize yield determinants.
- Suitability modeling for maize cultivation.
- Visualization of high-risk and high-yield zones.

## Repository Structure
- **ProjectFiles/**: ArcGIS Pro project file (`.aprx`), geodatabase, and layer symbology files.
- **Maps/**: Exported maps and layouts for presentation and sharing.
- **Data/**: Metadata or links to the datasets used in the project.
- **Documentation/**: Workflow, methodology, and project overview.

## Prerequisites
- ArcGIS Pro 2.x or later.
- Access to relevant geospatial datasets (e.g., soil maps, climate data).

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadiqbal92/MaizePredictionModeling-ArcGISPro.git
